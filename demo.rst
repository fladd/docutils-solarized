:abstract:

    This document is a demonstration of the Docutils-Solarized stylesheet.
    It containins examples of all basic reStructuredText constructs and many advanced constructs.
    Use the link in the header to switch between light and dark versions.

Structural Elements
===================

Section Title
-------------

That's it, the text just above this line.

Transitions
-----------

Here's a transition:

---------

It divides the section.

Body Elements
=============

Paragraphs
----------

A paragraph.

Inline Markup
`````````````

Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*,
**strong emphasis**, ``inline literals``, hyperlinks
(http://www.python.org), footnote references
(manually numbered [1]_, anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled
auto-numbered [#label]_, or symbolic [*]_), citation references
([CIT2002]_) and substitution references (|example|).
Character-level inline markup is also possible (although exceedingly
ugly!) in *re*\ ``Structured``\ *Text*.  Problems are indicated by
\|problematic\| text (generated by processing errors; this one is
intentional).

The default role for interpreted text is `Title Reference`.  Here are
some explicit interpreted text roles: a PEP reference (:PEP:`287`); an
RFC reference (:RFC:`2822`); a :sub:`subscript`; a :sup:`superscript`;
and explicit roles for :emphasis:`standard` :strong:`inline`
:literal:`markup`.

.. DO NOT RE-WRAP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!

Let's test wrapping and whitespace significance in inline literals:
``This is an example of --inline-literal --text, --including some--
strangely--hyphenated-words.  Adjust-the-width-of-your-browser-window
to see how the text is wrapped.  -- ---- --------  Now note    the
spacing    between the    words of    this sentence    (words
should    be grouped    in pairs).``

If the ``--pep-references`` option was supplied, there should be a
live link to PEP 258 here.

Bullet Lists
------------

- A bullet list

  + Nested bullet list.
  + Nested item 2.

- Item 2.

  Paragraph 2 of item 2.

  * Nested bullet list.
  * Nested item 2.

    - Third level.
    - Item 2.

  * Nested item 3.

Enumerated Lists
----------------

1. Arabic numerals.

   a) lower alpha)

      (i) (lower roman)

          A. upper alpha.

             I) upper roman)

2. Lists that don't start at 1:

   3. Three

   4. Four

   C. C

   D. D

   iii. iii

   iv. iv

#. List items may also be auto-enumerated.

Definition Lists
----------------

Term
    Definition
Term : classifier
    Definition paragraph 1.

    Definition paragraph 2.
Term
    Definition

Field Lists
-----------

:what: Field lists map field names to field bodies, like database
       records.  They are often part of an extension syntax.  They are
       an unambiguous variant of RFC 2822 fields.

:how arg1 arg2:

    The field marker is a colon, the field name, and a colon.

    The field body may contain one or more body elements, indented
    relative to the field marker.

Option Lists
------------

For listing command-line options:

-a            command-line option "a"
-b file       options can have arguments
              and long descriptions
--long        options can be long also
--input=file  long options can also have
              arguments

--very-long-option
              The description can also start on the next line.

              The description may contain multiple body elements,
              regardless of where it starts.

-x, -y, -z    Multiple options are an "option group".
-v, --verbose  Commonly-seen: short & long options.
-1 file, --one=file, --two file
              Multiple options with arguments.
/V            DOS/VMS-style options too

There must be at least two spaces between the option and the
description.

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``).  They can be indented::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Or they can be quoted without indentation::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?


Code Blocks
-----------

With syntax highlighting:

.. code:: python

    from os import path as p


    def test(a, b):
        """A test."""

        if a > b:
            return True
        elif b > a:
            return 42
        else:
            raise Exception



Line Blocks
-----------

| This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
|     Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
|     Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
| Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
  they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
|     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
  the left edge of the text above it.

| This is a second line block.
|
| Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

    | A one, two, a one two three four
    |
    | Half a bee, philosophically,
    |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
    | But half the bee has got to be,
    |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
    |
    | But can a bee be said to be
    |     or not to be an entire bee,
    |         when half the bee is not a bee,
    |             due to some ancient injury?
    |
    | Singing...

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Doctest Blocks
--------------

>>> print 'Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"'
Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"
>>> print '(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)'
(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)

Tables
------

Here's a grid table followed by a simple table:

+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| Header row, column 1   | Header 2   | Header 3 | Header 4 |
| (header rows optional) |            |          |          |

+------------------------+ span rows. | - contain           |
| body row 4             |            | - body elements.    |
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

Citations
---------

.. [CIT2002] Citations are text-labeled footnotes. They may be
   rendered separately and differently from footnotes.

Here's a reference to the above, [CIT2002]_.

Directives
----------

.. contents:: :local:

These are just a sample of the many reStructuredText Directives.  For
others, please see

An example of the "contents" directive can be seen above this section
(a local, untitled table of contents_) and at the beginning of the
document (a document-wide `table of contents`_).
